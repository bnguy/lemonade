# lemonade

“I was served lemons, but I made lemonade.” Despite the painful experiences that everyone goes through, there is a way to overcome them and make them better.

Lemonade is an online forum that contains stories that people share about their experiences with mental illnesses. This allows people to find others who have gone through similar experiences, making them feel as if they are not alone in their struggles. We aim to promote a safe and nonjudgmental environment.
